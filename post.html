    <div class="container">

                <h2 class="section-heading"> What are cistus? </h2>

                <p> Cistus, commonly known as rock roses or sun roses, are bushy, spreading, small to medium-sized
                    evergreen shrubs. Native to southern Europe and northern Africa, they naturally grow alongside
                    plants such as lavender, sage and broom on thin, nutrient-poor soil.  </p>

                <p> Although our climate and garden conditions are quite different, cistus are generally hardy, reliable
                    and easy to grow in the UK, as long as they get plenty of sunshine and have very free-draining soil.
                    They aren’t particularly long-lived, however, with most providing a good flowering display for
                    around ten years. </p>

                <h2 class="section-heading"> Choosing the right cistus for you </h2>

                <p> There are 20 or so species of cistus, as well as several widely grown hybrids and numerous
                    cultivars, giving gardeners plenty of choice. Still, it can be hard to know which will grow well and
                    look best in your garden, so to help you choose the right plant, consider the following:  </p>

                <h3> Hardiness </h3>

                <p> The vast majority of cistus species are hardy in the UK, as long as they're not planted in frost
                    pockets or on exposed sites. In colder parts of the country, consider the hardier
                    species Cistus laurifolius, C. × hybridus and C. × cyprius and their cultivars.  </p>

                <p> Cistus ladanifer and its cultivars, popular for their dark crimson-blotched petals and aromatic
                    resin-coated leaves, need a more sheltered position.  </p>

                <h3> Soil pH </h3>

                <p> Many cistus grow equally well in neutral, slightly acidic or slightly alkaline soil. Some, however,
                    are better able to tolerate alkalinity, so if you have chalky soil, consider one of the
                    following:  </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Cistus × argenteus</li>
                    <li> C. albidus</li>
                    <li> C. creticus</li>
                    <li> C. × dansereaui </li>
                    <li> C. laurifolius</li>
                    <li> C. monspeliensis</li>
                    <li> C. × pulverulentus</li>
                    <li> C. × purpureus</li>
                </ul>
                <p> Cistus ladanifer and its cultivars, on the other hand, show a preference for acidic conditions and
                    may become chlorotic (yellow) in alkaline soils as they get older.   </p>

                <h3> Flower colours </h3>

                <p> Cistus are grown for their profusion of summer flowers, borne over a long period, in shades of
                    white, pink and purplish-red, some with a prominent crimson blotch at the base of each
                    petal. Cistus monspeliensis ‘Vicar’s Mead’, with soft yellow petals, offers something a little
                    different.  </p>

                <p> To best appreciate their display, choose a colour that complements the rest of your planting scheme.
                    White and soft-pink flowers blend well with the blue hues of other Mediterranean favourites, darker
                    pink injects colour into bright and hot schemes, while those with blotched petals make eye-catching
                    specimen plants.  </p>

                <h3> Eventual size and shape </h3>

                <p> Cistus come in a range of shapes and sizes, from low-growing but
                    wide-spreading Cistus salviifolius ‘Prostratus’, at as little as 30cm (1ft) tall, to the upright,
                    bushy habit of C. ladanifer at 2.4m (8ft) or more.  </p>

                <p> The vast majority of popular cultivars grow to between 50cm (20in) and 2m (6⅔ft), with a spread
                    similar to their ultimate height. If you are after a particularly low-growing plant for the front of
                    a border, a wide-spreading one to fill a sunny bank or a tall one to frame other plants, then check
                    labels carefully when browsing to ensure they’re suitable for your needs.  </p>

                <p> For help choosing a cistus you could: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Take a look at our plant lists of cistus by colour and size</li>
                    <li> Visit a renowned dry or gravel garden, such as RHS Garden Hyde Hall or The Beth Chatto Gardens,
                        to see cistus in mixed plantings
                    </li>
                    <li> Visit the National Collection holder</li>
                    <li> Use RHS Find a Plant and search for ‘cistus’ to browse photographs and plant descriptions. You
                        can also narrow your search criteria by soil type, hardiness, flower colour and RHS Award of
                        Garden Merit, to find those best suited to your requirements
                    </li>
                    <li> Look for cultivars with an RHS Award of Garden Merit, which shows they performed well in RHS
                        trials, so are reliable choices - 16 cistus cultivars have an RHS AGM
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2 class="section-heading"> How and what to buy </h2>

                <p> Cistus are widely sold in garden centres as container plants, usually in 2–3L pots. As they are not
                    particularly long-lived shrubs, and flower well from a young age, it is usually not worth buying
                    larger specimens.  </p>

                <p> As evergreens, they are likely to be available year-round, but it is easiest to assess vigour and
                    compare flowers if bought during late spring and summer. </p>

                <p> When browsing: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Look for plants with plenty of growth near the base of the stems. Cistus get leggier as they
                        mature, and buying a plant in this condition will make it harder to train and will shorten its
                        lifespan in your garden
                    </li>
                    <li> Avoid those with moss, weeds or liverwort on the surface of the compost, as this too suggests
                        you are buying an older plant
                    </li>
                    <li> Avoid those showing signs of stress, damage or disease – particularly any broken branches
                        or yellowing leaves
                    </li>
                </ul>
